  <h3>What does "Microservices Architecture" mean?</h3>
  <description>
    A Microservice Architecture is an architecture that<br>
    allows to create a single page application by dividing<br>
    the overall application into smaller services. This means<br>
    each service is responsible of one thing. It is very<br>
    versatile but the problem comes when it is time to define<br>
    how big or small is the thing that it is responsible for.<br>
    Microservices is helpful and convenient because every service<br>
    is independently deployable and scalable and it is not needed<br>
    to do it for all the application but only that service.<br>
    On the contrary, a monolith architecture needs has all of its<br>
    functionality in a single process which means it needs to be<br>
    replicated completely. That doesn't mean a monolith is not<br>
    useful since it is great and easier for small applications.

  <h3>Creae a grunt task to deploy your website to your own bucket in S3</h3>
  <description>
    First a plug in needs to be created. In this case I used:<br>
    require('time-grunt')(grunt);<br><br>
    Then the task needs to be added. Within it the "" needs to be included. <br>
    grunt.registerTask('deploy', [<br>
    'clean:dist',<br>
    'wiredep',<br>
    'useminPrepare',<br>
    'concurrent:dist',<br>
    'postcss',<br>
    'ngtemplates',<br>
    'concat',<br>
    'ngAnnotate',<br>
    'copy:dist',<br>
    'cdnify',<br>
    'cssmin',<br>
    'uglify',<br>
    'filerev',<br>
    'usemin',<br>
    'htmlmin',<br>
    'deployWebPage'<br>
    ]);<br><br>
    After that it had to be specified what attrobiutes should contain the task:<br>
    //Deploy WebPage<br>
    deployWebPage: {<br>
    options: {<br>
    key: '*key',<br>
    secret: '*key',<br>
    bucket: 'brandongq',<br>
    access: 'public-read',<br>
    connections: 5<br>
    },<br>
    dist: {<br>
    files: [{<br>
    expand: true,<br>
    cwd: 'dist/',<br>
    src: '**/*.*',<br>
    dest: './'<br>
    }]<br>
    }<br>
    }<br><br>
    And lastly the task shoul be run as I called it:<br>
    grunt deploy<br>

  <h3>Explain how routes work in Angular and code example</h3>
  <description>
    Angular brings everything from the server in order to have it with itself.<br>
    It is useful when a Singl Web Application is needed. This way the webpage is<br>
    not completely reloaded but just the parts that need to be reloaded.<br>
    In other words it "divides" the webpage into smaller parts named "views"<br>
    and makes it more manageable.<br>
    Example:<br>
    var sampleApp = angular.module('phonecatApp', []);<br>
    <br>
    sampleApp .config(['$routeProvider',<br>
    function($routeProvider) {<br>
    $routeProvider.<br>
    when('/addOrder', {<br>
    templateUrl: 'templates/add-order.html',<br>
    controller: 'AddOrderController'<br>
    }).<br>
    when('/showOrders', {<br>
    templateUrl: 'templates/show-orders.html',<br>
    controller: 'ShowOrdersController'<br>
    }).<br>
    otherwise({<br>
    redirectTo: '/addOrder'<br>
    });<br>
    }]);<br>

  <h3>Explain how you can have more than one access key in your computer and how to use each one. Provi code or confguration examples.</h3>
  <description>
    To have more than one access key it is necessary to add to<br>
    the file that contains the keys the other keys that want to<br>
    be used. They must have a different label than "[default]" <br>
    and to use them it that label must be specified. <br><br>
    Example: <br><br>
    [default] <br>
    aws_access_key=*insert key here*<br>
    aws_secret_access_key=*insert key here*<br>
    <br>
    [key2] <br>
    aws_access_key=*insert different key here*<br>
    aws_secret_access_key=*insert different key here*<br>

  <h3>Explain what are you going to do different this semester based on last semester experience.</h3>
  <description>
    Since I didn't take a class the las semester  I cannot make a <br>
    comparison to it but I can say that I will manage my time in<br>
    a better way than before. Also, I will give more importance to <br>
    all my classes and focus more on them. I will read what I have<br>
    to read and watch the videos that I need to see and, if time<br>
    allows me to, I will do some extra study.
